# **Modular Energy Asset Management Center**  

### **Overview**  
`RenewXControl` is a structured application for monitoring and controlling renewable energy assets (batteries, wind turbines, solar panels). It uses **interfaces and dedicated classes** to ensure flexibility, scalability, and maintainability.  

---

## **Why This Design?**  

### **1. Problem Solved**  
Renewable energy systems involve diverse assets with unique properties (e.g., batteries track charge, turbines monitor wind speed). A rigid design would:  
- Require rewriting code for each new asset type.  
- Mix unrelated logic (e.g., solar/wind logic in one class).  
- Make debugging harder due to tight coupling.  

### **2. Solution: Interfaces & Modular Classes**  
By splitting operations into **read** and **write** interfaces, the system:  
- **Standardizes interactions** across assets.  
- **Isolates changes** (e.g., adding a new asset doesn’t break existing code).  
- **Simplifies testing** (each asset type can be tested independently).  

---

## **Key Components**  

### **1. Read Operations**  
- **Purpose**: Fetch data from assets (e.g., battery charge, wind speed).  
- **Interfaces**:  
  - `IReadOp`: Base for all assets (e.g., `GetActivePower()`).  
  - Asset-specific interfaces (e.g., `IReadBatteryOp` adds `GetSoC()`).  
- **Benefit**:  
  - A wind turbine doesn’t need battery methods, reducing clutter.  

### **2. Write Operations**  
- **Purpose**: Send commands to assets (e.g., set power output).  
- **Interface**: `IWriteOp` (e.g., `SetSp()` for setpoints).  
- **Benefit**:  
  - Uniform control across assets, even if their internals differ.  

### **3. Read/Write Classes**  
- **`Read` Class**: Implements all `IRead...` interfaces.  
  - Initialized for a specific asset (e.g., `Read(battery)`).  
  - Only exposes relevant methods (e.g., `GetSoC()` for batteries).  
- **`Write` Class**: Implements `IWriteOp`.  
  - Handles all asset updates via `SetSp()`.  
- **Benefit**:  
  - Clear separation: reading logic never mixes with writing logic.

## **Workflow Example**  
1. **Setup**:  
   ```python
   battery_read = Read(battery)  # Initialize for a battery
   turbine_write = Write(turbine)  # Initialize for a turbine
   ```  
2. **Read Data**:  
   ```python
   charge = battery_read.GetSoC()  # Gets battery charge
   windspeed = turbine_read.GetWs()  # Gets wind speed
   ```  
3. **Send Commands**:  
   ```python
   battery_write.SetSp(80.0)  # Sets battery to 80% power
   ```

## **Benefits of This Design**  

| **Feature**          | **Advantage**                                                                 |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Interfaces**       | Ensures all assets support required operations without redundant code.       |
| **Modular Classes**  | Changes to wind logic don’t affect solar logic.                              |
| **Scalability**      | Add a new asset (e.g., hydro) by creating its interfaces—no refactoring.     |
| **Type Safety**      | Prevents calling `GetWs()` on a battery (compile-time checks).               |
| **Testing**         | Mock interfaces for unit testing; no real hardware needed.                   |

## **When to Use This Pattern**  
This design is ideal for:  
- Systems with **multiple asset types** sharing some behaviors.  
- Projects expecting **future expansion** (new assets, features).  
- Teams needing **clean separation of concerns**.  

For small projects with a single asset type, this might be overkill.
