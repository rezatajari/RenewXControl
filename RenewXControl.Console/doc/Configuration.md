# Configuration Workflow

## Overview
Our application uses an external configuration file to initialize and manage various components dynamically. Instead of hardcoding values, we rely on a structured configuration file that allows users to define initial settings, making the system more flexible and adaptable.

## Purpose of Using Configuration
Using configuration files provides several benefits:
- **Separation of Concerns:** Keeps initialization logic separate from the applicationâ€™s core functionality.
- **Flexibility:** Allows users to modify settings without altering the code.
- **Scalability:** Makes it easy to introduce new configurable components in the future.
- **Maintainability:** Simplifies updates and adjustments to system parameters.

## How It Works
1. **Loading Configuration**: When the application starts, it reads the configuration file, which contains predefined settings.
2. **Deserialization**: The data from the configuration file is converted into structured objects that match the internal models of the application.
3. **Initialization**: These objects are then used to initialize components with their respective settings.
4. **Usage in Application**: Throughout execution, the system uses these preloaded configurations to control behavior dynamically.

## Why This Approach?
- **Avoids Hardcoded Values:** If changes are needed, they can be made in the configuration file without modifying the application code.
- **Supports Future Expansion:** New configurations can be added without affecting existing functionality.
- **Enables External Control:** Users or administrators can modify system parameters without requiring developer intervention.
