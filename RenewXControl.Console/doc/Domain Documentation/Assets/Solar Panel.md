# Solar Panel - Actions & Behaviors

## Overview
Solar panels play a vital role in the **RenewXControl** system by converting sunlight into electricity. The system continuously monitors solar panel performance, ensuring optimal energy production while considering battery storage capacity.

## Properties
Each user configures their own solar panel properties based on their specific assets. The system maintains flexibility while ensuring a minimum operational threshold.

- **Light Sensor (Irradiance Measurement)**: Measures sunlight intensity (minimum value: 0 W/mÂ²).
- **Wind Speed Sensor**: Measures environmental wind speed (minimum value: 0 km/h).
- **Active Power**: Indicates the electricity generation capacity of the solar panel (minimum value: 0 kW).
- **SetPoint**: Determines whether the panel should generate electricity or be turned off.
- **Connection to Battery**: Ensures that generated electricity is stored efficiently.

## Behavior & Workflows
The solar panel system operates dynamically, making decisions based on real-time monitoring every **second**. The system ensures optimized energy generation and efficient battery usage.

### Real-Time Monitoring & Decision-Making
- The system **reads sensor data** every second to assess sunlight intensity, wind speed, and active power generation.
- Based on the collected data, the system decides if the panel should **activate or deactivate**.
- If the **battery reaches full capacity**, the system **automatically stops** the panel to prevent overcharging.
- If energy demand increases or storage capacity allows, the panel **resumes operation**.
- This real-time control ensures **efficient energy utilization and prevents energy wastage**.

## Benefits of Solar Panel Monitoring
- **Optimized Energy Generation**: Ensures solar panels operate efficiently based on real-time sunlight conditions.
- **Automated Decision-Making**: Reduces the need for manual intervention by users.
- **Prevention of Energy Waste**: Stops solar panels when battery storage is full, preventing unnecessary strain.
- **Scalability & Flexibility**: Each user configures their own solar panel properties, allowing adaptation to various renewable energy infrastructures.

By following this structured approach, solar panels can be managed efficiently while maintaining **sustainability and operational flexibility**.
