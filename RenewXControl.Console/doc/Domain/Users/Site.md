# Site Overview in RenewXControl

## Introduction
In the **RenewXControl** system, a **site** represents a user's renewable energy infrastructure, where assets such as wind turbines, solar panels, and batteries are installed. The system is designed to provide real-time monitoring, decision-making, and energy management tailored to each site's specific configuration.

## Site Components
Each site consists of:
- **User**: The owner or operator managing the renewable energy infrastructure.
- **Assets**: Wind turbines, solar panels, and batteries configured based on user requirements.
- **Configuration Settings**: Customizable parameters that define how assets operate within the site.

## Site Functionality
1. **Asset Registration & Configuration**
   - Users register assets and configure parameters such as power capacity, sensor thresholds, and charging settings.
   
2. **Real-Time Monitoring**
   - The system collects data from all assets per second to track energy production and storage.
   
3. **Automated Decision-Making**
   - Based on collected data, the system optimizes energy flow by controlling asset operations dynamically.
   
4. **Energy Distribution & Sales**
   - Generated energy can be stored or sold to the grid based on predefined user configurations.
   
5. **Scalability & Flexibility**
   - Each user manages their own independent site, with scalable infrastructure that adapts to different energy needs.

## Benefits of Site Management in RenewXControl
- **Customizable Configuration**: Each user defines how their assets interact within their site.
- **Optimized Energy Usage**: Ensures efficient generation, storage, and distribution.
- **Seamless Integration**: Connects multiple assets within a single, unified system.
- **Automated Control**: Reduces manual intervention with intelligent decision-making.

This structured approach ensures that sites within the **RenewXControl** system operate efficiently, providing sustainable and adaptive renewable energy solutions.
