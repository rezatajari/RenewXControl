# Battery - Actions & Behaviors

## Overview
The battery is a crucial component of the **RenewXControl** system, responsible for storing generated electricity from wind turbines and solar panels. It ensures a stable energy supply by managing charging and discharging operations efficiently.

## Properties
Each user configures their own battery properties based on their specific assets. The system provides flexibility while maintaining a minimum operational threshold.

- **Capacity**: The total energy storage capacity (minimum value: 0 kW).
- **State of Charge (SoC)**: Represents the current energy level of the battery (minimum value: 0 kW, maximum defined by user).
- **SetPoint**: Determines when the battery should charge or discharge.
- **Frequency of Discharge**: Defines how frequently the battery discharges stored energy (e.g., 5 kW per set frequency).
- **Connection to Energy Sources**: Manages energy flow between the wind turbine, solar panel, and battery.

## Behavior & Workflows
The battery operates dynamically, making real-time decisions every **second** to optimize energy storage and usage.

### Real-Time Monitoring & Decision-Making
- The system **reads battery data** every second to track SoC and energy demand.
- If the **battery is not full**, it continues **charging** from available sources.
- If the **battery reaches full capacity**, it stops charging and prevents overloading.
- Based on the **discharge frequency**, the battery releases stored energy efficiently.
- The system **automatically controls energy flow**, ensuring optimal battery lifespan and energy availability.

## Benefits of Battery Monitoring
- **Efficient Energy Storage**: Ensures energy is stored properly and utilized when needed.
- **Automated Charge & Discharge**: Reduces manual intervention by managing charging and discharging automatically.
- **Prevention of Energy Waste**: Stops overcharging and manages discharging frequency smartly.
- **Scalability & Flexibility**: Each user configures their own battery settings for personalized energy management.

This structured approach ensures that battery performance is optimized while maintaining **sustainability and operational flexibility**.
