# Overview of Asset

## Introduction
In the **RenewXControl** system, assets represent the physical components involved in renewable energy generation and storage. These assets include wind turbines, solar panels, and batteries. Each asset operates based on real-time data and user-defined configurations to ensure efficient energy management.

## Asset Categories
### 1. **Wind Turbine**
Wind turbines generate electricity by converting wind energy into electrical power. Each turbine is equipped with sensors that measure wind speed and active power output.
- **Wind Speed Sensor**: Measures the wind velocity.
- **Active Power**: Indicates electricity generation capacity.
- **SetPoint**: Controls turbine activation and deactivation.

### 2. **Solar Panel**
Solar panels convert sunlight into electrical energy and operate based on light intensity and environmental conditions.
- **Light Sensor**: Measures light intensity for efficiency tracking.
- **Active Power**: Defines the electricity generation capacity.
- **SetPoint**: Regulates when the panel should generate electricity.

### 3. **Battery**
Batteries store the generated electricity for later use, ensuring energy availability even during low-generation periods.
- **Capacity**: Defines the maximum storage capacity.
- **State of Charge (SoC)**: Represents the current energy level.
- **SetPoint**: Determines charge and discharge thresholds.
- **Discharge Frequency**: Manages energy release intervals.

## System Integration & Workflow
Each asset operates independently but is interconnected within the system. The workflow ensures optimal energy management:
1. **Data Collection**: Sensors continuously gather real-time data from wind turbines and solar panels.
2. **Decision Making**: The system processes this data to determine when to generate, store, or discharge energy.
3. **Energy Distribution**: Batteries store excess energy and release it based on user-defined conditions.
4. **User Configuration**: Each user customizes asset parameters to align with their specific infrastructure.

## Benefits of Asset Management in RenewXControl
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Ensures accurate tracking of energy generation and storage.
- **Automated Decision-Making**: Optimizes asset operations without manual intervention.
- **Scalable & Configurable**: Allows users to customize settings based on their energy needs.
- **Prevention of Energy Waste**: Stops overcharging and ensures optimal usage of resources.

This structured approach ensures that assets are managed efficiently, leading to sustainable and effective renewable energy utilization.
